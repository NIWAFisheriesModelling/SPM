We thank Nokome Bentley \href{http://www.trophia.co.nz}{(TROPHIA)} and Ian Ball \href{http://www.aad.gov.au}{(Australian Antarctic Division)} for their ideas that led to the development of the movement paradigm employed in this program. Thanks also to Adam Dunford, Andy McKenzie, Dave Gilbert, and Murray Smith \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{(NIWA)} for helpful discussions, suggestions for improvements, and error detection. The \SPM\ logo was designed by Erika Mackay \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{(NIWA)}. The copula preference function code and description in \SPM\ were contributed by Craig Marsh and are described in \cite{Marsh2015}.

Much of the structure of \SPM, equations, and documentation in this manual draw heavily on similar components of the fisheries population model CASAL \citep{1388}. We thank the authors of CASAL for their permission to use their work as the basis for parts of \SPM\ and allow the use of some of the definitions, concepts, and documentation from CASAL in \SPM. 

The development of \SPM\ was funded by the New Zealand \href{http://www.mpi.govt.nz}{Ministry for Primary Industries}, the \href{http://www.msi.govt.nz}{Ministry of Business, Innovation \& Employment} (Project C01X1001, Protecting Ross Sea Ecosystems), and the \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{National Institute of Water \& Atmospheric Research Ltd. (NIWA)} under NIWAs Fisheries Centre Research Programmes 1 and 3.
